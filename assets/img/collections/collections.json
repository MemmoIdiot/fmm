Plastic pollution is most visible in developing Asian and African nations, where garbage collection systems are often inefficient or nonexistent. But the developed world, especially in countries with low recycling rates, also has trouble properly collecting discarded plastics. Plastic trash has become so ubiquitous it has prompted efforts to write a global treaty negotiated by the United Nations.” - Laura Parker - A strong statement piece, and yet fun and “pop” in its look, the Re-float-able console aims at raising awareness about plastic pollution in the oceans. The buoys are 3D printed from 100% recycled plastic. Surprising in its challenging and defying balance and brightly summery colours, the buoy console seemingly floats off the ground as if it were really immersed in the sea. The steel chain which instead of being hanged from it, serves as the main support to the piece, is welded together as a whole column. The bespoke water effect glass top is hanged both above the chain and fixed to the wall through a small hook hidden inside the smaller white buoy.",

Representing an iceberg floating on the sea surface, the glacies table is also a statement piece denouncing the current climate crisis. The base is sculpted from a 160 kg block of raw alabaster, entirely handmade by masters in Volterra. The initial choice of the alabaster block is fundamental. Pure and transparent quality stone is needed. The veins are naturally present in the rock and give it its characteristic appearance. The block is emptied by hand in order to house the light. The glass atop the the alabaster closely resembles the surrounding oceans and completes the illustration.",

With sleek hand-finished solid brass legs, the cortex coffee table has retained the uneven edges that are characteristic uncut alabaster, a reminder of its historical and effortlessly chic state. The stark contrast between its edges and its legs gives rise to a unique balance and pay tribute to a marriage between that which is ancient and modern sleek design.",

The three Parcas decide to transform the nails into precious stones as they could not allow any part of Venus’ devine body to be lost or destroyed : these stones became onyx. Lunæ is born from the union of this legendary stone and mirror, in a symbol linked to Venus as well as being a symbol of beauty and femininity. According to its Latin etymology the name refers to the radiance of our white satellite which brightens the night sky and its reflected light. The moon is seen as a mirror of the sun, or as in this case, a reflection of light.",

Plinio is made of the basalt (lava) stone which emanates from volcanic eruptions and provides a vivid illustration of the beginnings of a pyroclastic flow, as superheated gas and rock are blasted into the atmosphere. The haunting depiction of the eruption is vividly captured in the table design, leaving little to the imagination. The black glass often formed in the process of an eruption rests atop and provides a smooth, elegant surface, belying the dramatic and seemingly-dynamic base, as a further contrast of rough and smooth surfaces create an even stronger intensity.",

                "description": "From the greek «pyr», meaning fire, used to make sparks and set fire when hit against stone or metal, the pyrite mineral is the inspiration for this cabinet. Also known as ‘fool’s gold’, the mineral presents itself as a cuboid crystalline structure and is represented in the piece through an assembly of multiple cubic containers of different volumes and sizes, meeting at odd angles to bring the ‘crystalline inspiration to life. The piece is presented as a majestic ornamental sculpture, half mineral, half abstraction, just like ‘fools gold’. The stoney and irregular base supports the cubist set perfectly, with the structure of pyrite resting on top. The cabinet openings are hidden to create a sense of surprise. Arranged on the 3 sides of the cabinet, they are of different sizes opened in two ways : the three front doors can be tilted whilst the two side doors are hinged. The wooden structure is coated with a special metal-based paint that undergoes complex processing to give it the typical colour of natural pyrite crystal. The whole piece blossoms and is suspended as if it were a metallic flowering of the marble on which it rests or from the wall on which it can be suspended. In fact the marble base in Portoro marble from Cinque Terre can also be removed and the cabinet suspended from the wall, like a natural crystallisation generating from it.",
