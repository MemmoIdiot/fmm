                                        Francesco Maria Messina was born in Pisa, Italy where he undertook classical
                                        studies. After
                                        attending the École Spéciale d’Architecture in Paris, he received his master's
                                        degree,
                                        graduating in 2015 from the innovative Confluence InsEtute in Lyon, France,
                                        founded
                                        by Odile
                                        Decq and Matteo Cainer. He then went on to have a brief experience at Tulane
                                        University in
                                        New Orleans, USA, before continuing his international experience abroad,
                                        initally
                                        working in
                                        Paris and then in Cameroon, Africa.
                                        Between 2018 and 2020, Francesco became a fully fledged designer conceiving and
                                        creating
                                        five design lines, while also partecipating in the launch of a new luxury

                                        named Cypraea, a Mauritian brand of which he was the creator and brand manager.
                                        His
                                        works
                                        were an immediate success and were exhibited at Rossana Orlandi’s Gallery in
                                        Milan

                                        In 2020, strengthened by this very successful experience, he returned to Tuscany
                                        and
                                        opened

                        <p>
                            All of our pieces are meticulously crafted by expert artisans in Tuscany, Italy, in
                            locations such as Carrara, Pisa, Volterra, and Florence, where there is great artistic and
                            historical value, as well as a fine tradition of craftsmanship dating back to Etruscan
                            times. We produce only a maximum of nine items in each series to maintain their exclusivity
                            and preciousness, with most of the work being handmade to add uniqueness. Our goal is to
                            offer our collectors items they can truly be proud of - authentic, rare, and one-of-a-kind
                            designs.
                            I believe in the value of authentic craftmanship and unique materials and the driving
                            force of my design practice is always the development of challenging concepts and the
                            pursuite of original, made-to-art cutting edge designs which challenge trends and commercial
                            movements.

                            “When designing, great importance is given to contemporary global issues
                            like global warming and ocean plastic pollution, to which the collections Glacies (dedicated
                            to polar and Alpine ice melting) and Re-plustic (made of 100% recycled plastic) are directly
                            referred to and aim to raise awareness about these tragic issues.
                            Just like climate change, coastal erosion, and polar ice melting, through the other
                            collections I have developed in the last 5 years, my personal mission is to raise awareness
                            about one of the most pressing global issues of our time: plastic pollution. My personal
                            commitment to this cause began many years ago
                            Between 2017 and 2020, during my time in the Indian Ocean, particularly in Mauritius, I
                            witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of plastic pollution on the marine ecosystem and
                            on the shores. I regularly participated in clean-up actions and tried to promote campaigns
                            with locals to stimulate and raise awareness about this issue. As a personal experience in
                            Africa, during my years spent in Cameroon, I also encountered many communities that were
                            unaware of the gravity of their actions and uneducated about the global issue of plastic
                            pollution. They used to regularly dump their trash on the roads or in the rivers. In that
                            case, it wasn’t a lack of goodwill but more of unawareness.
                            That is why I am committed to using my work to raise awareness and contribute educating
                            people about this critical issue. To address this problem, I began developing design objects
                            made from recycled plastic waste to transform something ugly and harmful into something
                            beautiful and functional. One of my recent pieces is the "refloatable" console, made of
                            buoys 3D-printed from 100% recycled plastic.
                            I believe that creating aesthetically appealing and fun designs can help spread the message
                            about the urgent need to combat plastic pollution, even in the field of collectible design,
                            which is still relatively new to adopting sustainable practices. Until recent years,
                            recycled plastic design was often seen as a lower-quality form of design, but that
                            perception is changing as more people recognize the importance of sustainability in all
                            areas of life.”
